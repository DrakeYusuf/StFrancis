        <h2>Historical Background</h2>
        <p>St. Francis Day and Boarding Primary School was established in 1989 by Mr. & Mrs Lukwago with a vision to provide quality education to the children of Ntinda and surrounding communities. Founded by a group of dedicated educators and community leaders, the school began as a small day school with just a few classrooms and a handful of students.</p>
        
        <p>Over the years, the school has grown significantly, expanding its facilities and programs to meet the increasing demand for quality education. What started as a modest institution has evolved into a comprehensive educational center that serves both day and boarding students.</p>
        
        <p>The school's commitment to academic excellence and holistic development has been unwavering since its inception. Through the dedication of its staff, support from parents, and the hard work of its students, St. Francis has consistently maintained high academic standards while fostering spiritual growth and moral values.</p>
        
        <p>Today, the school stands as a testament to the vision of its founders, offering modern facilities, a diverse curriculum, and a nurturing environment that continues to shape the lives of young learners. The school's rich history is reflected in its traditions, values, and the success stories of its alumni who have gone on to make significant contributions in various fields.</p>
